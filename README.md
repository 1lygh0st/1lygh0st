𓁻****Hello, I'm Vic!****𓁻

****Before you INT****

***|-|*** I'm not the best at conversation, I will *not* interact with you first. I'm also very shy and overthink my responses, so if I go silent it's because I don't know how to respond or I'm overthinking my response. ***|-|***

****DNI****

***|-|*** PLEASE DNI; Proshippers, Comshippers, Darkshippers, Transphobics, Homophobics, Sexists, Racists. ***|-|***

***|~|*** I also would apprectiate not talking about religion, since it's a very touchy subject, I would rather avoid it completely. ***|~|***
